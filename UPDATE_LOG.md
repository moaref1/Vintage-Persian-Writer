# Grid View & Bug Fix Update

## New Feature: Grid View
A new "نمای کلی" (Grid View) button has been added to the bottom toolbar.
- **What it does:** Shows all pages at once in a grid layout.
- **How to use:** Click the button to see thumbnails. Click any thumbnail to jump to that page.

## Bug Fixes
1. **Responsive Pagination:** resizing the window now automatically fixes page layouts.
2. **Crash Prevention:** Infinite loops in pagination are prevented with stricter safeguards.
3. **Optimized Rendering:** Grid view uses lightweight clones to prevent lag.

## Instructions
1. Refresh your browser.
2. Click "نمای کلی" to verify the new view.
